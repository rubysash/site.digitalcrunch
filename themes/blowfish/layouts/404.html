    <p>I’ve owned this domain for over 20 years. In that time, Digital Crunch has evolved alongside the industry:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Repair Era:</strong> Originally, I was a local expert fixing malware and hardware failures.</li>
      <li><strong>The Engineering Era:</strong> I transitioned into a professional cybersecurity engineer, implementing risk mitigation for Fortune 100 companies.</li>
      <li><strong>The AI Era:</strong> Today, I build hardened AI infrastructure and secure business automations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Whatever you were looking for—whether it was a 2005 hardware guide or a 2015 security note—it’s been replaced by something faster, smarter, and significantly more secure.</p>
