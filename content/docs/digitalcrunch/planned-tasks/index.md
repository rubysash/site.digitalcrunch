## Planned Tasks
- Create GPTs/Skills
- Create Content
- Create SVGs
- Create SOPs

## Overview

The main idea is building websites, Managing GHL CRM, and installing AI related services such as schema validation, AI SMS/Voice Bots and general web marketing services.

Instead of wordpress, we are using hugo, and doing things in a more technical way using AI, schema and git.    Basically we are still just making websites, but we are leaning even heavier on AI tools to do the work.

This work is done for clients of a company I am launching called "Digital Crunch" which will help solve technical problems related to all of the services above.

Your main part in this will be create content, and build some of the AI tools to assist you with this process.


## Phase 1

There are multiple stages to the work we are doing.   The first stage is to understand the tools, install them on your chromebook, and use AI to build the first tools you need.  


### Vocabulary

You will need certain vocabulary as a base for skills, which can be found here.  I urge you to read through every page once, so you know the basics and can refer to the details when needed.

### Hugo

Eventually, you will be using Hugo to manage content.   You can do this from the chromebook, but you need to understand what hugo is.  Read the overview page only.   The rest will not make sense until you actually install hugo and begin using it.

Official hugo documentation is useful to understand what hugo is, but my docs above might be easier to read than the official:

- https://gohugo.io/about/
- https://gohugo.io/documentation/

As all of our notes will be built in markdown, you need to understand what markdown is.  It's basically a simple langauge like HTML, but simpler.

### Git

Next you'll need to understand git, which is a file repository that tracks all of your changes in revisions.   When you are working on something it's uploaded to git, I can download and view/edit that version and re-upload it.   The website is automatically built form this.   

A crash course in git that I wrote is here:

Todo (me): Add git tutorial specific to our task

### Chrombook Setup

I use a chromebook, and have purchased a chromebook for you.   My instructions will be based on using the chromebook. I go through details on how to install linux and all of the tools needed here:

https://workers.digitalcrunch.com/docs/chromebook/hugo-on-chromebook/

You need specific account setup and will get errors until I have that setup.  That's my next task (for me).  Do not do this step yet until I have accounts setup.


## Your Tasks

Here are a list of the tasks that will be required and upcoming:

### Phase 1:
- Read Basics of Vocab, Hugo, Git, Chromebook
- Learn/Install/Configure AI related tools
- Build Your First AI Skill (Copywriting)


First, you need to understand what a skill is before you can create one:

https://workers.digitalcrunch.com/docs/ai/skills-catalog/

Then you will create each skill:

Creating skills will be done in markdown.    You can read up on everything in this document to see the overall process, and the tasks for this phase.


### Phase 2:
- Create SVG skill
- Create Content Pages using AI Copywriting Skill and SVG Skills
- Create infographics/media

Todo:  Add details/instructions

### Phase 3:
- Build additional AI Skills
- Learn GHL and Other AI related tools
- Build SOP documentation for AI tools and GHL
- Implement using the SOPs

Todo:  Add details/instructions
