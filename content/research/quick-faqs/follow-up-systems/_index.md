## Follow-Up Systems (SMS & Email)

Speed to lead wins deals. These are the questions we get about automated follow-up sequences in GoHighLevel.

#### Why is automated follow-up so important?

78% of deals go to the first responder. Not the best service. Not the lowest price. The first one to reply. If a lead fills out your form at 9pm and you respond at 9am the next morning, you already lost. Automated follow-up fires within seconds of form submission - SMS, email, or both. The lead gets a response before they finish browsing your competitor's site.

#### What is a follow-up sequence?

A follow-up sequence is a series of pre-written messages sent automatically over a defined time period. Example: Lead fills out form. Immediately gets a text. Two hours later, gets an email. Next day, gets another text. Three days later, another email. The sequence continues until the lead responds, books, or opts out. All of this runs without anyone on your team touching it.

#### Do you use SMS, email, or both?

Both. Different people respond to different channels at different times. Some check texts immediately. Some need the email in their inbox the next morning. We build multi-channel sequences that cover both without being aggressive. Each message is spaced, polite, and easy to opt out of.

#### Is SMS follow-up legal?

Yes, when done correctly. We configure opt-in compliance (TCPA), A2P 10DLC registration, and opt-out handling on every campaign. Leads must consent to receive texts - that consent is captured on your form. Every message includes an opt-out option. We do not cut corners on compliance because a single violation can cost $500-$1,500 per message.

#### What is A2P 10DLC and why does it matter?

A2P 10DLC is the registration system carriers (AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon) require for business text messaging. If your business sends texts from an unregistered number, carriers will filter or block your messages. We handle the full registration process through GHL and Twilio - brand registration, campaign registration, and number verification. Without this, your texts do not get delivered.

#### How many follow-up messages should a sequence have?

Depends on the offer and the sales cycle. For a simple appointment booking, 4-6 touches over 5-7 days is standard. For higher-ticket services with longer decision cycles, 8-12 touches over 2-4 weeks. The goal is persistence without annoyance. Most businesses give up after one or two attempts. That is where the money is - touches 3 through 7.

#### What do the follow-up messages say?

They follow proven sales methodology. Not "just checking in" - that gets ignored. Each message has a purpose:

- **Touch 1 (immediate):** Confirm receipt, set expectations, ask a qualifying question
- **Touch 2 (2-4 hours):** Provide value - a relevant tip, resource, or case study
- **Touch 3 (next day):** Address the most common objection for your service
- **Touch 4 (2-3 days):** Social proof - review, testimonial, or result
- **Touch 5 (5-7 days):** Direct ask with urgency or scarcity

Every message is written specifically for your business, your customers, and your offer.

#### Can the follow-up system hand off to a live person?

Yes. When a lead responds, the conversation routes to your team in the GHL app or via notification. The AI stops the automated sequence and a human takes over. You can also set rules - if a lead responds with certain keywords (like "call me"), it triggers an immediate notification or even a live transfer attempt.

#### What if a lead responds after hours?

Two options. First, the AI conversational bot can handle the reply in real-time - answering questions, qualifying the lead, and booking appointments. Second, the system can send an acknowledgment ("Got your message, we will follow up first thing tomorrow") and notify your team for morning callback. Either way, the lead knows they were heard.

#### How do you prevent follow-up messages from feeling spammy?

Spacing, relevance, and value. Each message is timed with enough gap to feel natural. Each message provides something useful - not just "are you still interested?" We vary the channel (text then email then text) and the angle (value, proof, urgency). The sequence also stops immediately when the lead responds or books. Nobody gets hammered with messages after they already engaged.

#### Can you reactivate old leads that went cold?

Yes. We build reactivation campaigns that re-engage your dormant CRM database. Past quotes, cancelled appointments, old inquiries - these are people who already know your name. A well-timed text months later catches them at the right moment. Reactivation costs almost nothing compared to acquiring new leads. Most businesses never follow up past the first attempt. That database is revenue you already paid for.

#### What does a follow-up system cost to run?

GHL handles the automation engine. SMS costs are per-message through Twilio (fractions of a cent per segment). Email sending is included in GHL or runs through a connected sender. The real cost is the setup - building the sequences, writing the copy, configuring the triggers, testing the flows. After that, it runs on autopilot for pennies per lead.

#### How do I know if the follow-up system is working?

GHL tracks everything. Open rates, reply rates, booking rates, opt-out rates. We monitor these and tune the sequences based on real performance data. If message 3 gets ignored but message 5 converts, we adjust. If SMS outperforms email for your audience, we shift the mix. Data drives the decisions.
