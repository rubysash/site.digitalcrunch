## Overview

This case study documents the end-to-end process of building a lead generation funnel for a car insurance client. It covers lead magnet strategy, email drip campaigns, domain selection, DNS configuration, email authentication, domain warm-up, funnel metrics, email marketing best practices, and pricing.

## Lead Magnet Strategy

### What Is a Lead Magnet?

Something you give people in exchange for their marketing permission. It should be gold, highly valuable and stupid difficult for them to resist the urge to get it.

### What Topics Go in a Lead Magnet?

Anything that solves a problem for your customer. Ideally it solves a problem but illustrates a new one that they didn't know they really had already. This establishes you as the trusted source for the solution.

### Lead Magnet Format Ideas

- Checklists
- Templates
- How-to Instructions
- Databases
- Curated Information
- Save Time / Save Money Guides
- Automation
- Memes / Jokes
- Lists
- Video
- Images

## Live Example: Car Insurance Savings Guide

### Target Audience

Car insurance customers looking to save money.

### Topic Selection Process

We generated 60 topic ideas using AI, then selected the 14 strongest for the lead magnet:

- Loyalty Trap
- Add-Ons
- Relocation Rates
- Policy Audit
- Forgiveness Myth
- Preferred Status
- Driving Record
- Fender-Benders
- Insurer Quality
- Agent Integrity
- First-Timers
- Roadside Risk
- CLUE Report
- Gap Insurance

### Creation Process

After the topics, we used a customGPT writer to build a skeleton and then fleshed the skeleton.   Here is the final product "Lead Magnet", which we give away in exchange for contact info.

### Production Workflow

The basic work after the lead magnet was generated by AI:

1. Flesh it out and verify accuracy/claims
2. Include images that are relevant
3. Present as PDF with come-back links built in.

## Lead Magnet Distribution

Getting the lead magnet in front of the right people is where most funnels fail. The landing page doesn't generate traffic on its own — you have to drive people to it. Here's every viable channel for this insurance lead magnet, ranked roughly by effort-to-return ratio.

### Facebook Groups + DM Autoresponder

This is the highest-leverage organic play. The mechanics:

1. Join local community groups, homeowner groups, car enthusiast groups, and personal finance groups where your target audience already hangs out.
2. Post genuinely useful content from the lead magnet topics — don't pitch, teach. A post like "Most people don't know that filing too many roadside assistance calls can raise your premium. Here's why..." gets engagement.
3. End the post with a soft CTA: "I put together a free guide covering 14 of these insurance traps — drop a comment or DM me if you want it."
4. Use GHL's or ManyChat's DM autoresponder to instantly send the `savings.decisiveinsurance.com` link to anyone who comments or messages.

**Tips for not getting banned:**

- Never drop links directly in group posts unless the group rules explicitly allow it. Facebook suppresses posts with external links and admins will remove them.
- Rotate your content angles — don't post the same thing across 10 groups in one day. Facebook flags that as spam behavior.
- Engage genuinely in the group before posting your own content. Comment on other people's posts first. Be a member, not a billboard.
- Limit to 2–3 group posts per day across all groups. More than that triggers Facebook's spam detection.
- If possible, become a recognized contributor in a few groups rather than spreading thin across dozens.

### Facebook and Instagram Ads

Paid traffic is the fastest way to scale once the funnel is converting organically.

- **Ad format:** Lead ads (form inside Facebook) convert higher but produce lower-quality leads. Traffic ads pointing to `savings.decisiveinsurance.com` produce fewer but more intentional signups — they had to leave the platform, which is a stronger commitment signal.
- **Targeting:** Homeowners, vehicle owners, life event triggers (just moved, just bought a car, recently married), age 25–55, household income targeting where available.
- **Creative:** Use one of the lead magnet topics as the hook. "Did you know filing too many roadside calls can raise your rates by hundreds?" works better than "Download our free insurance guide."
- **Budget:** Start at $10–20/day. At a $2–5 cost per lead (realistic for insurance), that's 2–10 new subscribers daily — enough to feed the warm-up schedule.
- **A/B test:** Run 2–3 ad variations with different hooks from different lead magnet topics. Let the data tell you which topic resonates most, then scale the winner.

### BNI and Local Networking

You're already in BNI — use that channel deliberately:

- **Make the lead magnet your referral tool.** Instead of asking BNI members to refer people who "need insurance help," give them something tangible: "If anyone in your network is frustrated with their car insurance costs, send them this link." A specific resource is easier to share than a vague introduction.
- **Present it during your BNI education slot.** Walk the group through one of the 14 topics in 5 minutes. End with "I turned all 14 of these into a free guide — here's the link for your clients and contacts."
- **QR code on your BNI materials.** Business cards, one-sheets, and presentation slides should all have a QR code pointing to `savings.decisiveinsurance.com`. Physical-to-digital conversion is underused in BNI.

### Google Business Profile

If Decisive Insurance has a Google Business Profile:

- Add the lead magnet link as a "Learn More" or "Get Offer" button.
- Create a Google Post highlighting one of the 14 topics with a CTA to download the guide.
- Google Posts expire after 7 days, so rotate through different topics weekly. This also gives you a steady content calendar with zero extra writing — the topics are already done.

### Referral Partners and Cross-Promotion

Insurance agents work adjacent to realtors, mortgage brokers, auto dealers, and financial advisors. These partners already talk to people in life transitions (buying a home, buying a car, relocating) — exactly when insurance decisions get made.

- **Give partners a co-branded version of the lead magnet** or simply a custom link they can share. GHL can track which partner sent the lead using UTM parameters or separate landing page variants.
- **Offer reciprocity.** Promote their lead magnet or service to your list in return. A realtor's "First-Time Homebuyer Checklist" to your subscribers, your insurance guide to their clients — everyone wins.
- **Make it stupid easy for them.** Don't ask partners to explain anything. Give them a pre-written text, email blurb, or social post they can copy-paste. The less friction, the more they'll actually share it.

### Email Signature

Every email sent from the agency — not just marketing emails — should include a link to the lead magnet in the signature. Something like:

> **Free Guide:** 14 Insurance Traps That Could Be Costing You Thousands → [savings.decisiveinsurance.com](https://savings.decisiveinsurance.com)

This turns every customer service email, every quote follow-up, and every internal communication into a passive distribution channel.

### Content Marketing / SEO

This is a slower burn but compounds over time:

- **Turn each of the 14 topics into a blog post** on the main `decisiveinsurance.com` site. Each post ends with a CTA to download the full guide at `savings.decisiveinsurance.com`.
- **Optimize for long-tail search terms.** People searching "does filing a roadside assistance claim raise my insurance" or "how to audit my car insurance policy" are exactly the audience for this guide.
- **Repurpose the blog posts as short-form video** (60–90 second Reels/TikToks/Shorts). One topic per video. End with "Link in bio" pointing to the landing page.

### YouTube and Short-Form Video

Insurance content performs surprisingly well on video because most people find insurance confusing and appreciate someone breaking it down plainly.

- **One topic = one video.** You already have 14 topics. That's 14 videos.
- **Format:** Talking head, screen share, or simple slides. Production value doesn't matter as much as clarity and personality.
- **YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok** — post the same video natively on all three platforms. Each platform rewards native uploads over cross-posted links.
- **Pin a comment with the landing page link** on every video. YouTube descriptions should include the link in the first two lines (above the fold).

### Direct Mail (Yes, Physical Mail)

Counterintuitive in a digital funnel, but physical mail stands out precisely because everyone else has abandoned it:

- A postcard with a compelling headline, a QR code to `savings.decisiveinsurance.com`, and a one-sentence value prop can outperform digital ads in certain demographics (homeowners 40+, specifically).
- USPS Every Door Direct Mail (EDDM) lets you target by ZIP code and carrier route for as little as $0.20/piece. For a local insurance agency, this can be highly targeted.
- Track it with a unique UTM parameter on the QR code link so you can measure conversion from direct mail separately.

### What NOT to Do

- **Don't spam your personal Facebook timeline.** Posting about insurance every day to your friends list trains people to ignore or unfollow you. One post introducing the guide is fine. Repeated pitches aren't.
- **Don't buy email lists and blast the lead magnet link.** This destroys your domain reputation before you even start the drip sequence. Every subscriber must opt in through the form.
- **Don't rely on a single channel.** If all your traffic comes from one Facebook group or one ad set, you're one algorithm change or account suspension away from zero leads.
- **Don't skip tracking.** Every distribution channel should have its own UTM parameters so you can see exactly where leads are coming from. Without this, you're guessing at what's working.

## Email Drip Campaign

### Follow-Up Strategy

We follow up with the same information from the lead magnet, but with more detail, delivered as a drip email sequence. Each email maps to one of the 14 selected topics.

### Content Production

A customGPT writes the email content, then we verify accuracy before scheduling as a drip sequence.

### Subject Line Best Practices

Subject lines are the single biggest lever on open rates. Every title above was crafted with these principles:

- **Keep it under 50 characters when possible.** Mobile devices truncate at roughly 35–40 characters. The most important words should land in that window. Several of our titles run long — consider A/B testing shortened variants (e.g., "Gap Insurance: Dealer vs Policy Add-On" instead of the full version).
- **Lead with curiosity or tension.** Words like "Truth," "Myth," "Trap," and "Secret" create an information gap the reader wants to close. Our titles lean heavily on this — that's intentional.
- **Use specific numbers.** "5 Questions," "10 Insider Tips," and "30 Minutes" outperform vague alternatives because they set concrete expectations.
- **Avoid spam trigger words.** Words like "free," "guaranteed," "act now," and excessive punctuation (!!!) trip content filters. Our titles stay clean of these.
- **Match the subject to the body.** Clickbait subjects that don't deliver destroy trust and train readers to stop opening. Every email must follow through on the promise in the title.
- **Preview text matters as much as the subject.** The preview text (the snippet shown after the subject line in most inboxes) is a second headline. Never let it default to "View this email in your browser" or other boilerplate. Write a deliberate 40–90 character preview for every send that complements the subject.

### Drip Cadence and Scheduling

Timing and rhythm matter as much as content:

- **Send the first email immediately upon opt-in.** This is your welcome/confirmation email with the lead magnet attached or linked. Delay here kills momentum — open rates on welcome emails are typically 50–80%.
- **Space emails 2–3 days apart during the first week.** The subscriber is most engaged right after opt-in. Capitalize on that window.
- **Move to every 3–5 days for the remainder of the sequence.** Fourteen emails over 6–8 weeks is a natural arc. Compress it and you risk fatigue; stretch it and you lose momentum.
- **Send on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday mornings.** Insurance is a considered purchase — mid-week, mid-morning (9–11 AM in the recipient's timezone) consistently outperforms other windows for B2C financial content.
- **Avoid weekends and Monday mornings.** Inbox competition is highest Monday morning and attention is lowest on weekends for this audience.
- **Build in a "re-engagement" checkpoint.** After email 7 (the halfway mark), check who hasn't opened any of the last 3–4 emails. Consider a re-engagement subject like "Still want insurance tips?" before continuing the sequence. Anyone who doesn't re-engage gets removed — sending to dead addresses tanks deliverability.

### Email Body Best Practices

- **One topic per email.** Each email maps to exactly one lead magnet topic. Don't dilute focus.
- **Keep it under 300 words.** Insurance content is dense by nature. Shorter emails get read; longer ones get skimmed or deleted. Link out to a blog post or resource if you need to go deeper.
- **One clear CTA per email.** Every email should have one thing you want the reader to do — click a link, reply, book a call. Multiple CTAs split attention and reduce action.
- **Write in plain language.** Insurance jargon alienates people. If you must use a term like "declarations page" or "CLUE report," explain it in the same sentence.
- **Use the reader's first name.** GHL merge fields make this easy. Personalized emails see 10–20% higher open rates on average.
- **Include a P.S. line.** It's one of the most-read parts of any email. Use it for a secondary CTA, a teaser for the next email, or a personal touch.
- **Plain text outperforms heavy HTML for drip sequences.** Fancy templates signal "marketing email." A clean, text-forward email that looks like it came from a real person builds trust, especially in financial services.

## Domain and Subdomain Strategy

### Why We Don't Send from the Root Domain

Using `decisiveinsurance.com` directly for marketing email is risky for several reasons:

- **Reputation isolation.** If something goes wrong with a campaign — a bad list, a spam complaint spike, a misconfigured authentication record — the damage is contained to the `reply` subdomain. The root domain's reputation stays untouched. This protects any other email services running on the root (corporate email, transactional notifications, etc.).
- **Separation of concerns.** The root domain likely already has its own SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for the primary mail system (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Rackspace, etc.). Mixing marketing sends into that same SPF record adds complexity and risk. A dedicated subdomain gets its own clean set of authentication records.
- **Industry standard.** Major senders (banks, insurers, SaaS companies) universally use subdomains for marketing mail. Mailbox providers expect this pattern and treat it as a signal of legitimate, well-managed sending infrastructure.
- **Easier warm-up.** A fresh subdomain can be warmed methodically without affecting existing mail flows on the root domain.

The tradeoff is that the subdomain starts with zero reputation and must be warmed from scratch, but that's far safer than risking the root domain's established reputation.

### What Is Domain Reputation?

Domain reputation is a score that mailbox providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) assign to your sending domain based on how recipients interact with your email. It determines whether your messages land in the inbox, the spam folder, or get rejected entirely.

Reputation is built on engagement signals: opens, clicks, replies, and forwards push it up. Bounces, spam complaints, spam trap hits, and low engagement drag it down. It's cumulative — every send either adds to or subtracts from your reputation. A single bad campaign can undo weeks of good behavior.

Unlike IP reputation (which matters more for high-volume senders on dedicated IPs), domain reputation follows you regardless of what IP or ESP you send from. If you switch from Mailgun to SendGrid tomorrow, your domain reputation comes with you. This makes it the most important long-term asset in your email infrastructure.

### Choosing the Subdomain

The subdomain should align with the lead magnet and newsletter message as a whole. We chose **https://savings.decisiveinsurance.com** because it conveys the best image subconsciously and is short.

### Subdomain Architecture

The two subdomains serve different purposes:

- **`savings`** → GHL landing page with lead capture form
- **`reply`** → Mailgun sending domain for outbound email

The landing page lives at `savings.decisiveinsurance.com`, and emails go out from `something@reply.decisiveinsurance.com`.

## DNS Configuration

### Why Two Subdomains?

DNS doesn't allow a CNAME to coexist with MX or TXT records on the same hostname. Since `reply` already has MX records (for Mailgun) and a TXT record (for SPF), adding a CNAME there would break everything.

### CNAME for the Landing Page (Why GHL Requires It)

GHL (GoHighLevel) hosts landing pages on its own infrastructure at `sites.ludicrous.cloud`. To serve your page at `savings.decisiveinsurance.com` instead of a generic GHL URL, you create a CNAME record that points `savings` to GHL's servers. When a visitor navigates to `savings.decisiveinsurance.com`, DNS resolves the CNAME, and GHL's servers respond with your landing page content. Without this record, your custom domain simply doesn't resolve — visitors get a DNS error instead of your form. GHL manages the SSL certificate on their end once the CNAME is verified, so the page loads over HTTPS automatically.

### SPF Records Explained

SPF (Sender Policy Framework) tells receiving mail servers which infrastructure is authorized to send email on behalf of your domain. When a server receives an email claiming to be from `reply.decisiveinsurance.com`, it checks the SPF TXT record for that subdomain. If the sending server's IP matches one of the authorized sources, SPF passes. If not, SPF fails, and the message is more likely to be flagged or rejected.

Our SPF record includes three sources:

- **`include:mailgun.org`** — Authorizes Mailgun's servers, which is where GHL routes outbound email.
- **`include:spf.leadconnectorhq.com`** — Authorizes GHL's Lead Connector infrastructure for any sends that route through LC Email rather than Mailgun directly.
- **`include:emailsrvr.com`** — Authorizes Rackspace Email servers if the root domain or related services use Rackspace for corporate email.

The `-all` at the end is a hard fail — it tells receiving servers to reject anything not on the authorized list. This is the strictest setting. Some setups use `~all` (soft fail) during initial configuration to avoid accidentally rejecting legitimate mail, then tighten to `-all` once everything is confirmed working.

SPF has a 10-lookup limit. Each `include:` statement triggers one or more DNS lookups. If the total exceeds 10, SPF breaks entirely and evaluates as a permanent error. Three includes is well within the limit, but be cautious about adding more without checking the lookup count (use mxtoolbox.com/spf.aspx to verify).

### SRV Records

SRV records aren't part of the Mailgun or GHL setup. They're used for service discovery protocols like SIP, XMPP, CalDAV, etc. — not standard email delivery or web hosting.

### Complete DNS Records

| Type | Host | Value | Priority |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| CNAME | savings | sites.ludicrous.cloud | — |
| CNAME | email.reply | mailgun.org | — |
| MX | reply | mxa.mailgun.org | 10 |
| MX | reply | mxb.mailgun.org | 10 |
| TXT | reply | "v=spf1 include:mailgun.org include:spf.leadconnectorhq.com include:emailsrvr.com -all" | — |
| TXT | _dmarc.reply | "v=DMARC1;p=none;" | — |
| CNAME | smtp._domainkey.reply | (from GHL/Mailgun) | — |
| CNAME | k1._domainkey.reply | (from GHL/Mailgun) | — |

### MX Records Explained

MX is for inbound mail. But Mailgun requires them on the `reply` subdomain for **bounce handling**. When an email you send bounces, the receiving server sends a bounce notification back to the envelope sender domain. Mailgun needs those MX records so it can catch those bounces and report delivery failures back to GHL.

Without them, you lose visibility into hard bounces, soft bounces, and complaint loops — which means GHL can't auto-suppress bad addresses, and your sender reputation degrades silently.

### DKIM Setup

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) adds a cryptographic signature to every outgoing email, allowing receiving servers to verify the message hasn't been tampered with and truly came from your domain. It's one of the three pillars of email authentication alongside SPF and DMARC.

Go into GHL → Settings → Email Services, and when you add `reply.decisiveinsurance.com` as a Mailgun sending domain, it will generate two DKIM CNAME records for you. They'll look something like:

```
CNAME  smtp._domainkey.reply  →  mailgun.org
CNAME  k1._domainkey.reply    →  (value Mailgun provides)
```

The exact values are keypair-specific and must come from the GHL/Mailgun dashboard — you can't generate them yourself, they're tied to the signing keypair Mailgun creates for your domain. Just add whatever it gives you to your DNS.

## Email Authentication: DMARC Policy

### DMARC Progression

**`p=none` — Monitor only (start here)**
Does nothing to stop spoofed emails, but tells receiving servers to send you reports about who's sending as your domain. This is your "make sure everything's working" phase. You want to confirm that your legitimate GHL/Mailgun emails are passing SPF and DKIM before you start telling servers to reject failures.

**`p=quarantine` — Move to this after 2–4 weeks**
Tells receiving servers to send failing messages to spam. This catches spoofing attempts while giving you a safety net — if you misconfigured something, legitimate emails land in spam rather than vanishing entirely.

**`p=reject` — The goal**
Tells receiving servers to flat-out refuse emails that fail authentication. This is what you want for an insurance brand. Someone spoofing `reply.decisiveinsurance.com` to phish your prospects gets blocked outright.

### Enabling DMARC Reporting

Add a reporting address to your DMARC record:

```
"v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@decisiveinsurance.com;"
```

Once the reports show clean passes for a couple weeks, bump to `quarantine`, watch another week or two, then go to `reject`. The whole progression takes about a month if things go smoothly.

## Domain Warm-Up and Reputation Building

### Why Warm Up?

`reply.decisiveinsurance.com` is a brand new sending domain with zero history. Mailbox providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) treat unknown domains with suspicion.

### Warm-Up Schedule

| Week | Volume | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | 10–20 emails/day | Only most engaged contacts (people who know you, will open and click) |
| 2 | 30–50/day | |
| 3 | 75–100/day | |
| 4+ | Scale toward target volume | |

The key is generating opens and clicks early. That positive engagement signals to mailbox providers that recipients want your mail.

### Building and Protecting Domain Reputation

Domain reputation is the long game. Every email you send either deposits into or withdraws from your reputation account. Here's what to track and what to do:

**Where to check reputation:**

- **Google Postmaster Tools** — Register `reply.decisiveinsurance.com` and you'll see domain reputation rated as High/Medium/Low/Bad. Aim for High. This is the most important one since Gmail is the biggest mailbox provider.
- **Microsoft SNDS** — Similar dashboard for Outlook/Hotmail delivery.
- **Mailgun's built-in analytics** — Bounce rates, complaints, deliverability stats right in the dashboard (or through GHL's reporting).

**Habits that protect reputation:**

- Never buy or scrape lists — only mail people who opted in through your landing page.
- Set up a sunset policy — if someone hasn't opened in 60–90 days, stop mailing them.
- Use double opt-in on the `savings.decisiveinsurance.com` form if possible (confirmation email before they hit the main list). This hurts conversion slightly but keeps your list extremely clean.
- Include a visible, one-click unsubscribe link (required by law anyway, and Gmail/Yahoo now enforce list-unsubscribe headers).
- Keep your content consistent — sudden shifts in sending patterns or content type trigger filters.

### Realistic Timeline

It typically takes 30–60 days of consistent, clean sending to build a solid reputation. After about 90 days with good metrics you'll have an established domain that mailbox providers trust. The first two weeks are the most fragile — one bad batch to a stale list can tank things before you even get started.

Since this is a lead gen landing page with form opt-ins, you're in a good position — those are inherently warm contacts who just gave you their info. That's exactly the kind of engagement signal you want early on.

## Funnel Metrics and KPIs

### Full Funnel Metrics

Tracking email metrics alone gives you half the picture. A complete view of funnel health requires monitoring from first page visit through to conversion:

| Stage | Metric | Healthy Target | Danger Zone | Where to Track |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Landing Page** | Page visits (unique) | Baseline varies by traffic source | Sudden drops indicate broken links or DNS issues | GHL analytics / Google Analytics |
| **Landing Page** | Form conversion rate | 20–40% for targeted traffic | Below 10% | GHL form analytics |
| **Landing Page** | Bounce rate (page) | Under 60% | Over 80% | Google Analytics |
| **Landing Page** | Average time on page | 30+ seconds | Under 10 seconds | Google Analytics |
| **Opt-In** | New subscribers per day | Tracks to ad spend / traffic volume | Declining trend with stable traffic = form problem | GHL contact reports |
| **Opt-In** | Double opt-in confirmation rate | 70–85% | Below 50% (if using double opt-in) | GHL / Mailgun |
| **Email** | Open rate | 30%+ | Below 15% | GHL / Mailgun analytics |
| **Email** | Click rate | 2–5%+ | Below 1% | GHL / Mailgun analytics |
| **Email** | Bounce rate | Under 2% | Over 5% | Mailgun dashboard |
| **Email** | Spam complaint rate | Under 0.1% | Over 0.3% | Google Postmaster Tools / Mailgun |
| **Email** | Unsubscribe rate | Under 0.5% per send | Over 1% per send | GHL automation reports |
| **Email** | List growth rate | Net positive monthly | Net negative (unsubs + bounces > new signups) | Manual calculation |
| **Engagement** | Reply rate | Any replies are a strong signal | — | GHL inbox |
| **Engagement** | Forward/share rate | Any forwards are a strong signal | — | Mailgun (if trackable) |
| **Conversion** | Quote requests / calls booked | Depends on offer and volume | Zero conversions after full sequence = content/CTA problem | GHL pipeline / calendar |
| **Revenue** | Cost per lead | Track from day one | Rising CPL with flat conversion = funnel leak | Manual: ad spend ÷ subscribers |
| **Revenue** | Cost per acquisition | Track from day one | — | Manual: total cost ÷ customers |

### Drip Sequence Performance Dashboard

Track each email in the sequence individually. Engagement naturally declines over a drip sequence, but you want to identify which emails are underperforming relative to their position:

| Email # | Title (short) | Open Rate | Click Rate | Unsub Rate | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------|------------|------------|-------|
| 1 | Loyalty Trap | — | — | — | Expect highest opens (50%+), first impression |
| 2 | Add-Ons | — | — | — | |
| 3 | Relocation Rates | — | — | — | |
| 4 | Policy Audit | — | — | — | |
| 5 | Forgiveness Myth | — | — | — | |
| 6 | Preferred Status | — | — | — | |
| 7 | Driving Record | — | — | — | Mid-sequence checkpoint — re-engage or remove cold subscribers |
| 8 | Fender-Benders | — | — | — | |
| 9 | Insurer Quality | — | — | — | |
| 10 | Agent Integrity | — | — | — | |
| 11 | First-Timers | — | — | — | |
| 12 | Roadside Risk | — | — | — | |
| 13 | CLUE Report | — | — | — | |
| 14 | Gap Insurance | — | — | — | Final email — include strongest CTA |

Gmail specifically publishes a 0.3% spam complaint threshold — go above that and you're in trouble fast.

### What to Do With This Data

- **Low page visits, good conversion rate:** Traffic problem, not a funnel problem. Increase ad spend or organic distribution.
- **High page visits, low form conversion:** Landing page problem. Test headline, form length, offer clarity, page load speed.
- **Good signups, low open rates:** Subject lines aren't compelling, or emails are landing in spam. Check Postmaster Tools and test new subjects.
- **Good opens, low clicks:** Email content isn't driving action. Strengthen the CTA, shorten the body, or improve content relevance.
- **Good clicks, no conversions:** The post-click experience is broken — landing page, booking flow, or offer mismatch.
- **High unsubscribes on a specific email:** That email's content or tone is off. Rewrite or reposition it in the sequence.
- **Complaint rate spiking:** Immediate action required. Pause sends, review the offending email, check list quality, and verify authentication records.

## Email Deliverability Best Practices

### Authentication Checklist

Before sending a single email, verify all three authentication pillars are passing:

1. **SPF** — Confirm with `mxtoolbox.com/spf.aspx` that your SPF record for `reply.decisiveinsurance.com` is valid and under the 10-lookup limit.
2. **DKIM** — Send a test email and check headers for `dkim=pass`. Use `mail-tester.com` to verify.
3. **DMARC** — Confirm the `_dmarc.reply` TXT record is resolving. Start at `p=none` with `rua` reporting enabled.

If any of the three fail, do not proceed with sending. Fix the DNS first.

### List Hygiene

- **Never import a purchased, scraped, or aged list.** Every address on the list must have opted in through your form.
- **Validate email addresses at the point of collection.** GHL can be configured to reject obviously malformed addresses. Consider a verification service (NeverBounce, ZeroBounce) for imported lists.
- **Remove hard bounces immediately.** Mailgun handles this automatically, but verify it's working in GHL's bounce settings.
- **Suppress role-based addresses.** Addresses like `info@`, `admin@`, `support@` are more likely to generate complaints.
- **Monitor for spam traps.** A sudden spike in bounces or complaints from a specific mailbox provider often indicates a trap hit. Investigate immediately.

### Inbox Placement vs. Delivery Rate

Delivery rate (the percentage of emails accepted by the receiving server) is not the same as inbox placement (the percentage that land in the primary inbox vs. spam or promotions). You can have a 99% delivery rate and still have half your mail going to spam. Google Postmaster Tools is the most reliable way to monitor actual inbox placement for Gmail recipients.

### CAN-SPAM and Compliance

Every email must include:

- A valid physical mailing address.
- A clear, one-click unsubscribe mechanism that is honored within 10 business days (best practice: honor instantly).

- Subject lines that are not deceptive.

GHL's email builder includes most of these by default, but verify they're present in every template and automation.

## Pricing

### My Real Cost

- $297/month for unlimited slots
- $0.01 per message
- 20+ hours for one-time setup, 1-2 hour/month ongoing

### My Resell Cost

This is the price we intend to sell for:
