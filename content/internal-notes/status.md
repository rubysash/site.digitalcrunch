Here's something nobody tells you when you start running an agency: The platforms you sell aren't actually single tools.

GoHighLevel isn't one piece of software. Neither is most of what you're reselling. They're collections of 10-15 different services connected together with code.

And when something stops working, it's almost never the platform's fault.

Let me show you what's really happening.

The Truth About Software Platforms

Take GoHighLevel. When you sell it to a client, they think they bought "one system."

But here's what's actually running:

When their voice AI answers the phone? That's Retell AI.
When their chatbot responds? That's OpenAI or Claude.
When they get a text message? That's Twilio.
When they process a payment? That's Stripe.
When their website loads? That's Cloudflare.

GoHighLevel just connects them all together.

This isn't unique to GHL. Almost every SaaS platform you resell works this way. They're wrappers around other services.

Which means: When something breaks, you need to know which underlying service failed. Not just "it's not working."

Here's What Actually Happens

It's 8 PM. Your restaurant client texts: "The reservation bot isn't working. People are calling and nobody's answering."

If you don't know about status pages:
You email platform support. Wait 1-2 days. Client is pissed. You look helpless. Maybe you lose the account.

If you know about status pages:
You check Retell's status page. See the outage notice. Text your client back in 90 seconds: "Retell AI is down platform-wide. They're estimating 45 minutes. I'm watching it."

Client thinks you're on top of it. You look competent. That's the difference.

What to Do When Something Stops Working





Check the main platform's status page first (GoHighLevel, whatever you're using)



If it's green, figure out which service is broken based on what's not working



Check that specific status page



Read the incident update - they usually say when it'll be fixed



Wait. Most outages resolve in under 2 hours.



Only contact platform support if it's been 4+ hours and nothing shows on any status page

Things You Need to Know

Status pages can lag by 10-30 minutes. Something might be broken before it shows as "down." If multiple clients report the same problem simultaneously, it's probably an outage even if the page hasn't updated.

You don't control any of this infrastructure. When Retell goes down, nobody can fix it except Retell. When OpenAI has issues, every AI chatbot on the planet stops working. That's just how modern software works.

The status pages exist so you can diagnose problems yourself instead of waiting days for support to tell you something you could've checked in 30 seconds.

This applies to EVERY platform you resell. Not just GHL. If you're selling Zapier, HubSpot, Mailchimp, whatever - they all have status pages. Find them. Bookmark them.

What This Actually Does for Your Business

When you know the status pages, you stop looking confused when clients report problems.

Instead of "Let me check with support and get back to you," you say "OpenAI is experiencing an outage. They're working on it. Should be resolved within the hour."

Clients think you're competent. You're not scrambling. You're monitoring the situation professionally.

That's the difference between looking like a vendor who resells software versus looking like a technical partner who understands the infrastructure.
