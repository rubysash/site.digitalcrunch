I. Core Identity & Linguistic Pivot

    Primary Brand: Digital Crunch

    The Descriptor: Autonomous Systems

    The Pivot Strategy: Transition from "Tech Blog" to "Engineering Infrastructure" by leveraging 21 years of domain authority as "Digital Concrete." We frame "Crunch" as the high-pressure AI environment that only enterprise-grade systems can navigate.

II. Domain Strategy (The Sovereign Fortress)

    Root Domain (digitalcrunch.com): Pivoted to Agency Core. Direct 21-year authority focused on the "Autonomous Systems" mission.

    Information Architecture:

        /services/: Defined as "System Components." Clear, high-impact blocks for Lead Gen, Infrastructure, and AI.

        /research/: The "Intelligence Engine." Houses the legacy tech blog DNA, thousands of articles, and deep-dive schema research to maintain SEO weight and technical authority.

    Subdomain Ecosystem (Surgical Targeting):

        audit.digitalcrunch.com: Security and performance diagnostics.

        deploy.digitalcrunch.com: System implementation and onboarding.

        build.digitalcrunch.com: Lead generation and sales-force automation landing pages.

III. The SMILE & SCRATCH Audit (Retrofit)

    SMILE (Strengths): Suggests speed/power; Imagery of a data-crunching machine; Legs for any high-tech vertical.

    SCRATCH (Mitigation): To avoid the "Tame" or "Bloggy" feel of the legacy name, the brand voice uses Direct & Staccato prose and Obsidian visual weights to signal "Enterprise Hardened."

IV. Definition of Done

    [x] 21-year domain reclaimed for Agency pivot.

    [x] Hierarchy of Services vs. Research finalized.

    [x] Subdomain nomenclature (Audit/Deploy/Build) established for ad-spend surgical strikes.
