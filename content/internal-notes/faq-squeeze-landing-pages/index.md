## Squeeze Pages & Landing Pages

These are the most common questions we get about lead capture pages built in GoHighLevel. If your question is not here, book a call.

#### What is the difference between a squeeze page and a landing page?

A squeeze page has one job - capture a name and email (or phone number). Nothing else on the page. No navigation, no footer links, no distractions. A landing page is broader. It can include service details, testimonials, pricing, and multiple CTAs. Both are built in GHL. Use a squeeze page when you are running paid ads and need maximum conversion. Use a landing page when someone needs more information before they commit.

#### Why do you build landing pages in GoHighLevel instead of WordPress?

GHL pages are directly connected to your CRM, automation workflows, and calendar. When a lead fills out the form, they are instantly tagged, added to a pipeline, and entered into a follow-up sequence. No plugins. No Zapier. No broken integrations six months later. WordPress requires bolting together five different tools to do what GHL does natively in one platform.

#### How fast do GHL landing pages load?

GHL pages are hosted on their CDN and load fast out of the box. They are not as fast as a static Hugo site (which scores 100s consistently), but for a lead capture page tied to paid ads, the speed is more than sufficient. The tradeoff is direct CRM integration versus raw speed. For most ad campaigns, that tradeoff makes sense.

#### Can I use my own domain for landing pages?

Yes. We configure your custom domain or subdomain to point to your GHL-hosted pages. Your prospects see yourbusiness.com/offer, not some generic GHL URL. SSL is included. DNS records are configured by us.

#### What should my squeeze page include?

- A headline that states the specific result or offer
- A subheadline that addresses the pain point
- A form with as few fields as possible (name + phone or name + email)
- A single CTA button with action-oriented text
- No navigation menu, no footer links, no external links

Every extra field or distraction reduces conversion. We test this.

#### Do you design the pages or do I provide the design?

We handle the build. You provide the offer details - what you are giving away, what problem it solves, and who it is for. We write the copy, structure the layout, and connect all the automation. If you have brand guidelines or specific images, send those over and we match them.

#### What is a lead magnet and do I need one?

A lead magnet is the thing you give in exchange for contact information. A checklist, a guide, a free quote, a discount code, a video training. You need one if you are running paid ads to a squeeze page. Nobody gives up their email for nothing. The lead magnet must be specific and relevant to what you sell. "Free HVAC Maintenance Checklist" beats "Subscribe to Our Newsletter" every time.

#### Can the landing page book appointments directly?

Yes. GHL has native calendar booking. We embed the calendar widget directly on the landing page or link to a booking page after form submission. The prospect picks a time, gets a confirmation, and enters your pipeline automatically. No back-and-forth emails.

#### How do you track landing page performance?

GHL tracks form submissions, page views, and conversion rates natively. We also configure UTM parameter tracking so you can see which ads, campaigns, and traffic sources are producing leads. If you run Google Ads or Meta Ads, we set up conversion tracking pixels on the thank-you page.

#### Can I A/B test different landing pages?

Yes. GHL supports split testing between page variants. We set up the test, define the traffic split, and monitor which version converts better. Changes are made based on data, not guesses. Most businesses never test their pages. That is money left on the table.

#### What happens after someone fills out the form?

That depends on the automation we build behind it. At minimum: the lead gets tagged in your CRM, enters a pipeline stage, and receives an instant confirmation (SMS, email, or both). From there, we can trigger a follow-up sequence, notify your sales team, book them on a calendar, or route them to a specific workflow based on their answers. The form is the start of the system, not the end.

#### How many landing pages do I need?

One per offer. One per campaign. One per audience segment. If you sell three services, you need at least three landing pages. If you run ads to homeowners and commercial clients, those are separate pages with different messaging. Generic "contact us" pages convert poorly because they speak to nobody specifically.
