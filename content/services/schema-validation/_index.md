Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of positioning your business as the definitive, trusted answer that AI search engines and LLMs confidently select and cite.  The easiest way to optimize is to validate your schema and include proper schema on your webiste.

Digital Crunch is AEO Certified, a rare distinction in technical AI implementation, focused on reducing model uncertainty through deterministic data structures.

## Competitors Rank in AI

AI assistants like Perplexity and ChatGPT use a two-stage process: 

- Consensus Building and Detail Retrieval. If your competitors appear in AI summaries and you do not, it is likely because they have optimized their 'Indexability' via valid Schema. 
- AI crawlers prioritize content that uses structured JSON-LD to explicitly declare facts, rather than relying on probabilistic scraping of plain text.

## Cost of Invalid Schema

### 1. Data Quality & "Schema Drift"

Schema Markup must explicitly match the visual content on your page. When your JSON-LD and visual text disagree—known as 'Schema Drift'—AI models flag the data as unreliable, causing an immediate drop in your Confidence Score and citation rate.

### 2. Legal Risks & Regulatory Fines
While Schema itself is a technical standard, the data it carries (pricing, availability, reviews) is subject to consumer protection laws. 
- **Deceptive Trade Practices**: If your Schema advertises pricing or services that are not actually available, you may be liable for "bait-and-switch" litigation.
- **ADA Compliance**: Incorrectly structured data can interfere with screen readers, leading to potential lawsuits under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
- **GDPR/CCPA**: Inadvertently including PII (Personally Identifiable Information) in public-facing Schema can lead to significant regulatory fines.

## Technical Validation Tools

We verify all implementations against the official industry standards to ensure 100% crawlability.  You can test your own site now at these locations
