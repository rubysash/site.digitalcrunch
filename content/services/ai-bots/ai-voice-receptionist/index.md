## The Missed Call Problem

If you run a service business, you know the math:
*   **62%** of calls to small businesses go unanswered.
*   **85%** of customers whose call is missed will not call back-they call your competitor.
*   Hiring a full-time receptionist costs **$3,000+ per month**.

Speed to lead is your only competitive advantage. Voicemail is where leads go to die.

## Always-On Agent

We deploy human-like AI voice agents (powered by Retell, VAPI and GHL) that act as your front-line intake team. They don't get sick, or upset. They don't take breaks, and they handle multiple calls at once 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

*   **Instant Response:** Answers immediately, day or night
*   **Natural Conversation:** Pauses, listens, and responds like a person
*   **CRM Integration:** Logs call recording, transcript, and lead details instantly
*   **Appointment Setting:** Checks live calendar availability and books the meeting
*   **Transfer Option:** Can transfer to a live operator if requested

## Try It Live

Most AI bots feel "robotic" because of the lag. Our implementations are tuned for high-speed response, allowing for natural, fluid conversation.

> **Demo Instructions:**
> 1. Click the button to start the call.
> 2. Act like a customer interested in AI services.
> 3. Try to book an appointment (it will live search my actual calendar)
> 4. Watch how it handles your questions and secures the time slot.
> 5. Just hang up instead of book or give your info and confirm the booking if you want to talk

> **Engineer's Note:** While you listen, try to interrupt the agent. Notice the sub-500ms response time and the ability to handle mid-sentence corrections-this is the result of precision configuration.

If you wish, you can go ahead and book a schedule call too. Though you probably won't reach me directly, you can ask it transfer to me too.

**[Scheduled calls](https://jamesfraze.com) (on my calendar) are the best way to reach me** if you call, the AI agent will attempt to put you on my calendar.

## Engineering Details

We implement a **Technical Communication Layer** built on industry-leading infrastructure (Retell, VAPI, GHL) and optimized for professional environments.

* **Latency Optimization:** We minimize the "Think Time" of the AI. By tuning the voice-to-text-to-voice loop, we ensure the agent responds in real-time, preventing the awkward silences that make customers hang up.
* **Guardrail Development:** We build strict logic boundaries. Our agents don't "hallucinate" or make up prices; they stick to the vetted SOPs we configure for your specific brand.
* **NLP Configuration:** Our agents handle interruptions and complex human speech patterns, rather than following a rigid, frustrating script.
* **CRM Integration:** Call transcripts, lead scores, and calendar bookings are injected directly into your CRM with 100% data integrity.

## Performance Notes

We believe in transparency. For the AI to perform at its peak:

1. **Signal Quality:** Best on clear cellular or landline connections. Background noise or poor speakerphone echo can degrade transcription accuracy.
2. **Environment:** High-noise construction sites or loud traffic may impact parsing accuracy.
3. **Natural Interaction:** Clear input results in the fastest, most accurate bookings. Handles accents and varied speech well.
4. **Multiple Languages:** If your demographic is not English, we build bots in many languages for best results.

## Pricing

Hiring a full-time receptionist costs **$3,000+ per month**. Our AI implementations provide 24/7 coverage for a fraction of that cost.

* Less than **10 cents per minute** of actual usage
* Setup: 20-30 hours to build and test each AI bot
* Trained on your FAQs and proven sales frameworks
* Your existing receptionist gets freed for higher-value work

## FAQ

#### Does it sound like a robot?
No. We use high-fidelity neural voices with natural breathing and realistic tonality. Tuned for low-latency response. Most callers cannot tell the difference.

#### What if the AI gets stuck?
Every agent has guardrail logic. If it hits a question outside its scope, it offers a transfer to a live operator or takes a detailed message for priority callback. It does not guess.

#### Does this replace my CRM?
No. It feeds your CRM. Call recordings, transcripts, and lead details get injected directly into GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or whatever you run. Cleaner data than your staff enters manually.

#### Is my data secure?
We are a **Cybersecurity Engineer-led firm**. All integrations use encrypted API keys with scoped permissions. Your call data, CRM credentials, and customer PII are handled with the same rigor we apply to security engagements.

#### What if the caller has a thick accent?
The speech-to-text engine (Deepgram) handles accents well. Clear cellular or landline connections produce the best results. Heavy background noise is the bigger factor.

#### Can it handle multiple calls at once?
Yes. Unlike a human receptionist, the AI handles concurrent calls with no degradation. Ten calls at midnight get the same quality as one call at noon.

#### What if the caller wants a real person?
The agent is configured to offer a live transfer on request. If no one is available, it takes a message and logs it to your CRM with full context for a fast callback.

#### What happens during an outage?
We monitor Retell, VAPI, Twilio, and GHL uptime on our [Status Dashboard](/research/free-tools/status-dashboard/). If a platform goes down, calls fail over to your existing voicemail or forwarding number. Outages are rare but we plan for them.

#### Will it say things my business would never say?
No. Every agent runs on strict system prompts with defined boundaries. It cannot offer discounts, invent services, or quote prices unless we explicitly configure those responses. If it does not know, it escalates.

#### How long does setup take?
20-30 hours depending on complexity. We build the logic, configure CRM integration, test edge cases, and tune latency before a single live call. This is engineering, not a template install.

#### Can it book on my calendar?
Yes. The agent checks your live calendar availability in real-time and books directly. Supports GoHighLevel calendars natively. No double-booking. No back-and-forth.

#### What languages does it support?
Multiple. If your customer base speaks Spanish, French, or other languages, we build a dedicated agent tuned for that language. Mixed-language calls work but dedicated bots perform better.

#### Do I own the phone number?
The number is provisioned through Twilio under your account or ours depending on your preference. You retain control of your number if you ever leave.

#### What does "sub-500ms response" mean?
It means the AI responds in under half a second after you stop speaking. That is fast enough to feel like a real conversation. Most competitors run 1-2 seconds of dead air. Callers hang up during that silence.

## Why Digital Crunch

Most agencies just plug in a bot and hope for the best. We are led by a **Cybersecurity Engineer**. That means we configure the guardrails, optimize the latency, and ensure the integration with your CRM is robust and reliable.
