## **Missed Calls Cost Money**
If you run a service business, you know the math:
*   **62%** of calls to small businesses go unanswered.
*   **85%** of customers whose call is missed will not call back—they call your competitor.
*   Hiring a full-time receptionist costs **$3,000+ per month**.

## **Solution: "Always On" Agent**
We deploy human-like AI voice agents (powered by Retell, VAPI and GHL) that act as your front-line intake team. They don't get sick, or upset.  They don't take breaks, and they handle multiple calls at once 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

### **What It Does:**
*   ✅ **Instant Response:** Answers immediately, day or night.
*   ✅ **Natural Conversation:** Pauses, listens, and responds like a person, not a robot.
*   ✅ **CRM Integration:** Instantly logs the call recording, transcript, and lead details into your CRM.
*   ✅ **Appointment Setting:** Checks your live calendar availability and books the meeting while on the phone.
*   ✅ **Transfer Option:** Can optionally transfer to you if caller requests a live operator.

## **Why Digital Crunch?**
Most agencies just plug in a bot and hope for the best.

We are led by a **Cybersecurity Engineer** (James Fraze). That means we don't just "turn it on", we configure the guardrails, optimize the latency, and ensure the integration with your CRM is robust and reliable. We build systems that work.

## Experience Zero-Latency Logic
Most AI bots feel "robotic" because of the lag. Our implementations are tuned for high-speed response, allowing for natural, fluid conversation.

> **Demo Instructions:**
> 1. Click the button to start the call.
> 2. Act like a customer interested in AI services.
> 3. Try to book an appointment (it will live search my actual calendar)
> 4. Watch how it handles your questions and secures the time slot.
> 5. Just hang up instead of book or give your info and confirm the booking if you want to talk


> **Engineer’s Note:** While you listen, try to interrupt the agent. Notice the sub-500ms response time and the ability to handle mid-sentence corrections—this is the result of precision configuration.

If you wish, you can go ahead and book a schedule call too.   Though you probably won't reach me directly, you can ask it transfer to me too.

**[Scheduled calls](https://jamesfraze.com) (on my calendar) are the best way to reach me** if you call, the AI agent will attempt to put you on my calendar.

## The $3,000/mo Silent Leak
If you run a service-based business, "Speed to Lead" is your only competitive advantage.
* **62% of calls** to small businesses go unanswered.
* **85% of customers** hang up and call the next listing if they hit a voicemail.
* **Voicemail is where leads go to die.**
* How much are you paying your receptionist?

### "Always-On" Technical Asset
 We implement a **Technical Communication Layer** built on industry-leading infrastructure (Retell, VAPI, GHL) and optimized for professional environments.

### Why Engineering-Grade Implementation Matters:
* **Latency Optimization:** We minimize the "Think Time" of the AI. By tuning the voice-to-text-to-voice loop, we ensure the agent responds in real-time, preventing the awkward silences that make customers hang up.
* **Custom Guardrail Development:** We build strict logic boundaries. Our agents don’t "hallucinate" or make up prices; they stick to the vetted SOPs we configure for your specific brand.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Our agents are configured to handle interruptions and complex human speech patterns, rather than following a rigid, frustrating script.
* **Logic-Tested CRM Integration:** We ensure the data doesn't just "exist"—it flows. Call transcripts, lead scores, and calendar bookings are injected directly into your CRM with 100% data integrity.

## Technical Realities & Performance
We believe in transparency. For the AI to perform at its peak "Gold Standard," the following conditions are required:

1. **Signal Quality:** The AI performs best on clear cellular or landline connections. Background noise, heavy wind, or poor speakerphone echo can degrade the transcription accuracy.
2. **Environment:** Best results occur when the caller is in a standard environment. High-noise construction sites or loud traffic may impact the "Intelligent Logic" parsing.
3. **Natural Interaction:** Our bots are logic-driven. While they handle accents and varied speech well, clear input results in the fastest, most accurate bookings.
4. **Native Languages:** If your demographic is not English, we have bots in many languages.  You may want to create a bot that specializes in your demographics native language for best results.

## Pricing & Value
Hiring a full-time receptionist costs **$3,000+ per month**. Our AI implementations provide 24/7 coverage for a fraction of that cost.

Aside from never missing work, the average cost is less than 10 cents per minute of actual usage.   Setup fees allocate 20-30 hours to build and test each AI Bot.   We can even train your Bot to answer frequently asked questions, or follow sales frameworks that billion dollar companies also use.

Every business of any size can afford this, and will instantly recover the investment by having your receptionist do other, more meaningful and productive work.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does it sound like a robot?
No. We use high-fidelity neural voices that include natural breathing and realistic tonality. When configured with our low-latency optimization, most callers cannot distinguish it from a human.

### What happens if the AI gets stuck?
We build "Guardrail Logic" into every agent. If the AI encounters a question it cannot answer, it is programmed to politely offer a transfer to a live operator or take a detailed message for a priority callback.

### Does this replace my CRM?
No, it enhances it. The AI acts as the front-end data entry, injecting clean, qualified lead data and recorded transcripts directly into your existing CRM (GoHighLevel, HubSpot, etc.).

### Is my data secure?
As a **Cybersecurity Engineer-led firm**, security is our baseline. We ensure all integrations use encrypted API keys and follow best practices for data handling.
