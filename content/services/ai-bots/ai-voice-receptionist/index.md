## The Missed Call Problem

If you run a service business, you know the math:
*   **62%** of calls to small businesses go unanswered.
*   **85%** of customers whose call is missed will not call back—they call your competitor.
*   Hiring a full-time receptionist costs **$3,000+ per month**.

Speed to lead is your only competitive advantage. Voicemail is where leads go to die.

## Always-On Agent

We deploy human-like AI voice agents (powered by Retell, VAPI and GHL) that act as your front-line intake team. They don't get sick, or upset. They don't take breaks, and they handle multiple calls at once 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

*   ✅ **Instant Response:** Answers immediately, day or night
*   ✅ **Natural Conversation:** Pauses, listens, and responds like a person
*   ✅ **CRM Integration:** Logs call recording, transcript, and lead details instantly
*   ✅ **Appointment Setting:** Checks live calendar availability and books the meeting
*   ✅ **Transfer Option:** Can transfer to a live operator if requested

## Try It Live

Most AI bots feel "robotic" because of the lag. Our implementations are tuned for high-speed response, allowing for natural, fluid conversation.

> **Demo Instructions:**
> 1. Click the button to start the call.
> 2. Act like a customer interested in AI services.
> 3. Try to book an appointment (it will live search my actual calendar)
> 4. Watch how it handles your questions and secures the time slot.
> 5. Just hang up instead of book or give your info and confirm the booking if you want to talk

> **Engineer's Note:** While you listen, try to interrupt the agent. Notice the sub-500ms response time and the ability to handle mid-sentence corrections—this is the result of precision configuration.

If you wish, you can go ahead and book a schedule call too. Though you probably won't reach me directly, you can ask it transfer to me too.

**[Scheduled calls](https://jamesfraze.com) (on my calendar) are the best way to reach me** if you call, the AI agent will attempt to put you on my calendar.

## Engineering Details

We implement a **Technical Communication Layer** built on industry-leading infrastructure (Retell, VAPI, GHL) and optimized for professional environments.

* **Latency Optimization:** We minimize the "Think Time" of the AI. By tuning the voice-to-text-to-voice loop, we ensure the agent responds in real-time, preventing the awkward silences that make customers hang up.
* **Guardrail Development:** We build strict logic boundaries. Our agents don't "hallucinate" or make up prices; they stick to the vetted SOPs we configure for your specific brand.
* **NLP Configuration:** Our agents handle interruptions and complex human speech patterns, rather than following a rigid, frustrating script.
* **CRM Integration:** Call transcripts, lead scores, and calendar bookings are injected directly into your CRM with 100% data integrity.

## Performance Notes

We believe in transparency. For the AI to perform at its peak:

1. **Signal Quality:** Best on clear cellular or landline connections. Background noise or poor speakerphone echo can degrade transcription accuracy.
2. **Environment:** High-noise construction sites or loud traffic may impact parsing accuracy.
3. **Natural Interaction:** Clear input results in the fastest, most accurate bookings. Handles accents and varied speech well.
4. **Multiple Languages:** If your demographic is not English, we build bots in many languages for best results.

## Pricing

Hiring a full-time receptionist costs **$3,000+ per month**. Our AI implementations provide 24/7 coverage for a fraction of that cost.

* Less than **10 cents per minute** of actual usage
* Setup: 20-30 hours to build and test each AI bot
* Trained on your FAQs and proven sales frameworks
* Your existing receptionist gets freed for higher-value work

## FAQ

### Does it sound like a robot?
No. We use high-fidelity neural voices that include natural breathing and realistic tonality. When configured with our low-latency optimization, most callers cannot distinguish it from a human.

### What happens if the AI gets stuck?
We build "Guardrail Logic" into every agent. If the AI encounters a question it cannot answer, it is programmed to politely offer a transfer to a live operator or take a detailed message for a priority callback.

### Does this replace my CRM?
No, it enhances it. The AI acts as the front-end data entry, injecting clean, qualified lead data and recorded transcripts directly into your existing CRM (GoHighLevel, HubSpot, etc.).

### Is my data secure?
As a **Cybersecurity Engineer-led firm**, security is our baseline. We ensure all integrations use encrypted API keys and follow best practices for data handling.

## Why Digital Crunch

Most agencies just plug in a bot and hope for the best. We are led by a **Cybersecurity Engineer**. That means we configure the guardrails, optimize the latency, and ensure the integration with your CRM is robust and reliable.
