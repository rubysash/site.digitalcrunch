## **The Problem: Missed Calls Cost Money**
If you run a service business, you know the math:
*   **62%** of calls to small businesses go unanswered.
*   **85%** of customers whose call is missed will not call back—they call your competitor.
*   Hiring a full-time receptionist costs **$3,000+ per month**.

## **The Solution: Your "Always On" Agent**
We deploy human-like AI voice agents (powered by Retell and GHL) that act as your front-line intake team. They don't get sick, they don't take breaks, and they handle multiple calls at once.

### **What It Does:**
*   ✅ **Instant Response:** Answers immediately, day or night.
*   ✅ **Natural Conversation:** Pauses, listens, and responds like a person—not a robot.
*   ✅ **CRM Integration:** Instantly logs the call recording, transcript, and lead details into your CRM.
*   ✅ **Appointment Setting:** Checks your live calendar availability and books the meeting while on the phone.
