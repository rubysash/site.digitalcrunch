Digital Crunch engineers custom-built AI Agents designed to handle the high-volume, repetitive interactions that drain your team's resources. We don't just "plug in" a chatbot; we implement logic-driven automated systems that integrate directly with your existing CRM and workflow stack.

### Integrated Communication Channels
Our implementation expertise covers the full spectrum of automated business communication:

* **AI Voice Receptionist:** 24/7 inbound call handling with natural language processing—perfect for lead qualification and booking without the overhead of a call center.
* **Intelligent Web Chat:** Beyond "if-then" logic; these widgets use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to answer complex questions based on your actual business data.
* **SMS & Messaging Automation:** Automated lead follow-up and appointment reminders via SMS, WhatsApp, and Telegram.
* **Social & LinkedIn DM Agents:** Scalable outreach and response management for social platforms, ensuring no lead goes cold in the inbox.



Below you will find our deep-dive implementation guides and specific service offerings for each bot type. We are currently expanding this library weekly as we document our latest automation builds.
