## Your Competitors Have a System

The businesses dominating your local map pack are not getting more reviews because they do better work. They get more reviews because they **ask every single customer, every single time, automatically.**

After every job, their system fires an SMS. Then an email. Then a follow-up. No human remembers to do it. No one has to. The request goes out within minutes of invoice close, when the customer is still impressed.

You finish a job. Your tech drives to the next call. Nobody asks. The 5-star review that would have taken 30 seconds to leave never happens. Your competitor with 247 reviews owns the local pack. You sit at 38.

## The Math on Silence

The numbers are not subtle:

- **90%** of consumers read reviews before visiting a business
- Businesses with **more than 50 reviews** earn 266% more leads from Google Maps
- **One unanswered negative review** costs an average of 30 lost customers
- Google's local algorithm weighs **review velocity** -how often new reviews come in, not just total count

Your service quality is irrelevant if nobody documents it. Reviews are not testimonials. They are search ranking signals. Every week without new reviews, your competitors gain ground.

## Automated Review Campaigns

We build review generation systems inside GoHighLevel that run without human involvement. Every completed job triggers a multi-touch follow-up sequence designed to capture reviews at the moment of highest satisfaction.

### How the Sequence Works

| Step | Channel | Timing | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | SMS | Minutes after job close | Short, direct ask with one-tap Google review link |
| 2 | Email | 2 hours later | Slightly longer message with review link and thank-you |
| 3 | SMS | 24 hours | Gentle reminder for those who opened but did not complete |
| 4 | Email | 48 hours | Final touch with a different angle -"help future customers find us" |

The trigger is automatic. When your CRM marks a job complete, paid, or invoiced, the campaign fires. No staff action required. No clipboard at the front desk. No "I'll send that later."

### Why Multi-Channel

People check different things at different times. Some respond to texts immediately. Some need the email sitting in their inbox the next morning. The sequence covers both without being aggressive -each message is spaced, polite, and easy to ignore if they choose.

## AI Review Response

Getting reviews is half the equation. Responding to them is the other half.

Google has confirmed that **business responses to reviews factor into local ranking.** Responding signals an active, engaged business. Not responding signals abandonment.

We configure AI-powered response workflows that:

- **Reply to positive reviews** within minutes. Personalized, not generic. References the service type and customer name when available.
- **Reply to negative reviews** with professional, measured responses. Acknowledges the concern, offers resolution path, protects your brand publicly.
- **Flag critical reviews** for your personal attention when human judgment is needed -legal threats, false claims, competitor sabotage.

Every response maintains your brand voice. The AI does not apologize for things you did not do. It does not make promises you cannot keep. Guardrails are built into every template.

## Dead Lead Reactivation

Your CRM is full of leads that went cold. Quoted but never closed. Called but never followed up. Booked but cancelled. These are not dead leads. They are unworked opportunities.

We build reactivation campaigns that re-engage your dormant database using automated SMS and email sequences:

- **Past quotes** -"We quoted you on [service] back in [month]. Still need it handled?"
- **Cancelled appointments** -"Life gets busy. Want us to reschedule?"
- **Old inquiries** -"You reached out about [service]. We have availability this week."

### Why This Works

- These people already expressed interest. They know your name. The trust barrier is already lower.
- Reactivation costs almost nothing compared to new lead acquisition.
- Most of your competitors never follow up past the first attempt. A second touch months later often catches them at the right time.
- GHL automation handles the sequencing, opt-out compliance, and CRM status updates. No manual effort.

### Reactivation Sequence

| Step | Channel | Message Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | SMS | Short, casual check-in referencing original service interest |
| 2 | Email | Value-first message -seasonal relevance, limited availability, or pricing update |
| 3 | SMS | Direct ask -"Want me to put you on the schedule?" |
| 4 | Email | Final touch -soft close or opt-out acknowledgment |

Leads that respond get routed back into your active pipeline. Leads that do not respond get tagged and suppressed. Clean data, no spam.

## The Flywheel Effect

These three systems -review generation, AI response, and dead lead reactivation -feed each other:

1. **More reviews** improve your local ranking
2. **Higher ranking** drives more inbound leads
3. **More leads** mean more completed jobs
4. **More completed jobs** trigger more review requests
5. **Dead leads** get reactivated into the pipeline without new ad spend

This is not a one-time campaign. It is a self-reinforcing system that compounds over time. Every review makes the next one easier to earn. Every reactivated lead is revenue you already paid to acquire.

## Why Digital Crunch

Most agencies will set up a review request template and call it done. We engineer the full system.

- **GHL automation architecture.** Triggers, conditions, branching logic, and fail-safes. Not a single drip sequence -a system that adapts based on job type, customer segment, and response behavior.
- **Security-first CRM handling.** Your customer database is your most valuable asset. We handle CRM credentials and contact data with cybersecurity rigor, not marketing-agency carelessness.
- **Compliance built in.** Opt-out handling, A2P messaging compliance, suppression lists. We do not cut corners on deliverability or consent.
- **Continuous optimization.** We monitor review capture rates, response times, and reactivation conversion. The system gets tuned based on real performance data.

## Your Reviews Are Your Revenue

Every day without an automated review system is a day your competitors build a lead they cannot lose. Every dead lead sitting in your CRM is money you already spent going to waste.

You built the business. You do the work. Let us build the system that makes sure everyone knows about it.

**Led by a Cybersecurity Engineer. Built on GHL Automation. Engineered to Compound.**
