I needed to create paths, with coordinates on a given SVG so I could have another tool create animations from them. This is the result of what I needed to create.

- Load BG SVG File sample: <a href="/img/dc_logo.svg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download DC Logo</a>
- Adjust the big black window below (scroll)
- Click the Path you want to Trace
- Hold Space Bar and Drag if you need to
- Click "Copy" to save that Path
- Click "Clear" to make new Path
- Repeat

This is a specialized tool for creating paths on SVG files - however, it might be useful for CNC routing, Laser engraving and 3D printing because they all work with SVGs too.
